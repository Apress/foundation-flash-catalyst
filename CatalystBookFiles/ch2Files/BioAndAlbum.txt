bio:

A Cabaret-Folk Experience

THERE IS NOTHING SUBTLE HERE. Having had a career as a music theatre performer, this singer/ songwriter/ pianist now rests
in her own music. As source material Amanda draws upon life experiences, journal entries, arguments, anger, rants, love, people close to her, people distant from her, and the transit system.

Amanda's music is born of many lines. It is a heady swirl of folk, classical, cabaret, rock, music theatre, tongue in cheek humour and emotive storytelling.

album:

This is a woman’s story of self-criticism, grand illusions and sexual discovery relayed with brassy wit and an open heart. Imagine kids playing dress up and telling “big people” stories. Imagine a cabaret girl on speed, laughing and crying for the extremes of humanity when the scale could tip in either direction. This is a story of the fork in the road. A story of unending conflict: ecstasy and loathing; anger, confusion, and frustration paired with a desperate plea for understanding, compassion and self-acceptance. This album is part ‘showgirl strut’ and part ‘toddlers trusting, warm embrace’.
